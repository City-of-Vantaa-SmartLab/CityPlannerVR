/// Is used to check if a tile is full before we put the building down.
/// Option1: There is a little bug, where you can put building inside other if you can trigger the OnTriggerEnter() before leting go of the building 
///     (this doesn't break the game however (hopefully))
/// Option1: Is a bit heavy right now (propably)
/// Option2: There is a bug, where some of the tables are moved when initialized
